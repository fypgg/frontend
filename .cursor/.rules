    <csr-note>
        This app relies on Client Side Rendering so it uses Next.js as backend, but not file-based routing. It uses react-router instead, wrapping App imported with { ssr: false }. This enables smooth client-side navigation with potential for local-first and PWA features. App is rendered in a page that responds to every route using catch-all route, which is located in [[...static-app-shell]]. The exceptions are:
        - /send page, which just redirects to /
        - /send/:transferId page, which also redirects to / but has transfer metadata to render og image
        - /login page which is handled by NextAuth
    </csr-note>
    <next-navigation>
        There is a problem with Next.js navigation that cannot be avoided as for now.
        On page navigation, [[...static-app-shell]] will remount. This causes a lot of issues with components states as they are reset. To avoid this, we use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for application routes. Except for the share page, which is public.
